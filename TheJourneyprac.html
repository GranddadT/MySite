				<h2>About Page</h2>
				<h3>Let's try this again.</h3>	
				<p>This will be me chronicling my day.  Also, talking about the things I've done to improve my website and/or game.</p>	
				<p>Probably will be some misspelled words in here too; ya boy needs a spellcheck for everything.  Will be improving on this as time goes on.  Might make an "About" page later.</p>

				<p>AKA Juneteeth.</p> 		
				<p>Alright, got a new mouse.  Let's see if I can do this before my HARD deadline.  Gonna have to add some Bootstrap, when I get a chance.  Probably will have to download some things tonight.  Need to look into it some more.  Can't wait until I get to the server part.  Will be CSSing for the time being.</p>
				<p>LMAO, I forgot I can just call the Bootstrap from the web.  I be trippin most times.  Now I have to read up on what all I can do.</p>
				<h3>June 21</h3>
				<p>It seems like it's father's day.  Lololol I don't give a fuck about that shit.</p>
				<p>Anyways, let's see what on the agenda for today.  Maybe try to fix some of this bootstrap.  Maybe finally make that damn about page?  Maybe?  Get that damn spell check shit for sublime too.  Let me do that right now...later.</p>		
				<h3>June 22</h3>
				<p>Well, I found out why my bootstrap wasn't acting right; fucking "equal sign".  I mean, what the hell?  Almost 2 days.  Damn...</p>
				<p>It's all goo though.  I'm moving on and I know what to look for if it happens again.  I don't know what the fuck I'm looking for with bootstrap but I'm looking anyway.  Also found out that W3 has a bootstrap tutorial so I'll be hitting that up.  They got everything I'm looking for to be honest.  I guess I'll do this PHP stuff since it's easier to find tutorials for that. (Fuck you Ruby)</p>
